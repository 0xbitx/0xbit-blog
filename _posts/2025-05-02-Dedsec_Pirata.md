<h4 align="center">Command-line for plundering torrent files - search, discover, and save .torrent files for movies, cracked apps, music, OS ISOs, and more.</h4>

## DESCRIPTION

DEDSEC_PIRATA is a powerful terminal-based torrent hunter built for those who want full control over what they download.
